Some key things to focus on are the 1989 season where there was the most points scored across winning games, followed by 2017 almost 30 years later. Interestingly enough both the years prior to '89 and '17 were ranked at number 3 and 4 for most points scored. This graph is an excellent source for seeing which seasons were highest scoring. One outlier tends to be 1985 where the total number of win points was much lower compared to all other data points."

Box plots show spread in a easy to understand way as well as outliers and expected ranges. Some key outliers to look at is the 1990 season with a winning score of almost 150 points! Some important spreads to highlight are those of 1998, 1999 and 2002. The range of expected values is much smaller than that of 1988, and 1996. This tells us that the games in '96 and '88 were much more diverse in terms of highest and lowest scores compared to '98, '99, and '02."

        "This graph highlights a relatively small range of seasons but there is a clear trend in more points being scored from 1984-1990. There is also a small decrease in average win/lose points after 1988. This may conclude that something happened during the years of '84 and '85 that changed the game of basketball and led to more scoring overall. One noticable thing is that both win point trend lines and lose point trend lines both increase and decrease together. This helps us recognize that it wasnt just winning teams scoring more it was ALL teams on average scoring more points in those years."
